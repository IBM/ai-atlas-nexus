Coding Style Guidelines
We are using tools to enforce code style:

- iSort, to sort imports
- Black, to format code

We run a series of checks on the codebase on every commit using pre-commit. To install the hooks, run:
`pre-commit install`

To run the checks on-demand, run:
`pre-commit run --all-files`

## Secret scanning

This repository uses IBM's [detect-secrets](https://github.com/ibm/detect-secrets) to scan for secrets before the code is pushed to GitHub. Follow installation instructions in their repository: https://github.com/ibm/detect-secrets?tab=readme-ov-file#example-usage

To update the secrets database manually, run:

```
detect-secrets scan --update .secrets.baseline
```

To audit detected secrets, use:

```
detect-secrets audit .secrets.baseline
```

If the pre-commit hook raises an error but the audit command succeeds with just `Nothing to audit!` then run `detect-secrets scan --update .secrets.baseline` to perform a full scan and then repeat the audit command.

## Contributing to documentation

`pip install -e ".[docs]"`

We use [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to write documentation.

To build documentation, run

```bash
JUPYTER_PLATFORM_DIRS=1 mkdocs build
```

To run the documentation server, run:

```bash
JUPYTER_PLATFORM_DIRS=1 mkdocs serve
```

The server will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

### Pushing Documentation to GitHub Pages

Run the following:

```bash
mkdocs gh-deploy
```
